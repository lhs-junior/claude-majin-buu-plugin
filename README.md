## 🔮 The Majin Buu Philosophy

Just like Majin Buu absorbs powerful warriors to become stronger, this plugin **absorbs the best features from top Claude Code projects** and evolves into something more powerful through intelligent fusion.

**Current Absorption Rate**: 85% (30% → 85% improvement)
- 🧬 Absorbed from [claude-mem](https://github.com/supermemoryai/claude-mem): Memory system + Auto-categorization (75% absorbed)
- 🧬 Absorbed from [oh-my-claudecode](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode): Agent Tier System (30 agents) + Lifecycle Hooks (18 event types) + Execution Modes (Ultrapilot, Swarm, Pipeline) + Dashboard Fusion + Ralph Loop + Magic Keyword Detection + Persistent Mode State (85% absorbed)
- 🧬 Absorbed from [planning-with-files](https://github.com/OthmanAdi/planning-with-files): Planning + Findings + Progress tracking (95% absorbed)
- 🧬 Absorbed from [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers): TDD workflow + Git worktrees (70% absorbed)
- 🧬 Absorbed from [agents](https://github.com/wshobson/agents): 10 specialist agent types (15% absorbed)

**The Result**: A unified plugin that's stronger than the sum of its parts, with automatic Fusion cooperation between all absorbed features.

## What is this plugin?

A **Claude Code plugin** that extends Claude with stateful, integrated features through intelligent absorption and fusion. Provides 7 specialized systems working in perfect harmony through the Fusion system.

Reduces token usage from 6,100 to just 400-900 tokens per skill through intelligent on-demand loading. All data persists across sessions using SQLite. Skills load automatically based on your requests—mention "remember", "agent", "todo", or "test" and watch the magic happen.

## Key Features

- **7 Skill Files**: Memory, Agents, Planning, TDD, Guide, Science, Specialists
- **93% Token Reduction**: Load only skills you need (6,100 → 400-900 tokens)
- **Persistent State**: SQLite-backed memory, tasks, agent results, and test history
- **On-Demand Loading**: Skills load automatically based on your requests
- **Integrated Workflow**: All 7 skills work together seamlessly
- **Fusion System**: Automatic intelligent coordination between features (Lifecycle Hooks, Context Recovery, Workflow Automation, Unified Dashboard)

## 🙏 Absorbed Projects

This plugin has absorbed and evolved features from these excellent projects:

- [claude-mem](https://github.com/supermemoryai/claude-mem) - Memory management + Auto-categorization (75% absorbed)
- [oh-my-claudecode](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode) - Agent Tier System + Lifecycle Hooks + Execution Modes + Dashboard Fusion + Ralph Loop + Magic Keyword Detection + Persistent Mode State (85% absorbed)
- [planning-with-files](https://github.com/OthmanAdi/planning-with-files) - Planning + Findings + Progress (95% absorbed)
- [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) - TDD workflow + Worktrees (70% absorbed)
- [agents](https://github.com/wshobson/agents) - 10 specialist types (15% absorbed)

Like Majin Buu, we honor the strength of those we've absorbed while creating something uniquely powerful.
